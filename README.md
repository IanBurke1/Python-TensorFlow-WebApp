# Recognising Digits in Images
In this project I am required to create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. Flask will be used to run the web application and TensorFlow will be used to help with the digit recognition.
