# A Web Application for Recognising Digits in Images
#### *Emerging Technologies Module - 4th Year Software Development*
#### *Lecturer:  Ian McLoughlin (ianmcloughlin.github.io)*
For my project in [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/), I am required to create a web application in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) will be used to run the web application and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) will be used to help with the digit recognition.
