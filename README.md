# A Digit Recognition Web Application
#### *Emerging Technologies Module - Lecturer: [Dr Ian McLoughlin](ianmcloughlin.github.io) - 4th Year Software Development*
For my project in [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/), I am required to create a web application in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) will be used to run the web application and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) will be used to help with the digit recognition.

## Technologies

## Python 
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/Django.svg)]()

The main programming language used in this problem sheet is [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Flask
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Python micro web framework that provides tools, libraries and technologies that allow us to build a web application. 

## Numpy
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is a library for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

## TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a Python open source library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google. It is used for machine learning applications such as [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). It allows users to express arbitary computation as a graph of data flows. Nodes in this graph represent mathematical operations and the edges represent data that is communicated from one node to another. Data in TensorFlow are represented as tensors which are multidimensional arrays. 

## Keras

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is as high level neural network API running on top of TensorFlow. Designed to enable fast and easy experimentation with deep neural networks. Keras is more minimal than TensorFlow as it runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU. It allows for fast prototyping due to its user friendliness.
